We detected conflicts in visuo-haptic integration by analyzing event-related potentials (ERP) during interaction with virtual objects. In our EEG study, participants touched virtual objects and received either no haptic feedback, vibration, or vibration and EMS (Electrical muscle stimulation). We report a sensitiviy to unrealistic VR situations of an early negativity component at electrode FCz (prediction error), indicating we successfully detected haptic conflicts.
